		<p>
			I'm a developer/sysadmin in the Chicago area. Originally from the west coast, I graduated from CSU Bakersfield with a BS in Computer Science. I've been working with code since age 12, starting with HTML and Javascript and diving into C a couple years later. With 10 years and counting of education and experience, the sky is still the limit; while the Unix geek in me values the tried and true tools, I'm constantly exploring the newest technologies.

		<p>
			During my scheduled downtime, you can usually find me keeping up with the open-source world, playing jazz trumpet, bicycling, or sipping black coffee.
